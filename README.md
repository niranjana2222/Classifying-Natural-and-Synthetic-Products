# Classifying Natural and Synthetic Products

Abstract

Historically, the distinction between natural and synthetic products has been a gray matter in the pharmaceutical industry [22]. It has long been recognized that natural-product structures have the characteristics of high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity and other molecular properties that make them favorable as lead structures for drug discovery, and which serve to differentiate them from libraries of synthetic and combinatorial compounds [23]. Identifying and isolating characteristics of the two classes of compounds can allow for the development of distinguishable properties applicable to a variety of practices within cheminformatics. Current methods such as Binary Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling exist to classify compounds, yet none have been performed on the basis of molecular descriptors. Here, we propose a novel Random Forest-based approach with 1,800+ features computed through the Property and Descriptor Extraction Library (PaDEL) descriptor software to develop a method of classification for natural and synthetic products with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. The experimental accuracy of the machine learning methods outlined in this paper reach an accuracy of 89.19%, on par with and at times outperforming previous models in this classification. PaDEL descriptors provide an in-depth analysis of the two kinds of molecules; this differentiation allows for more efficient molecular design and provides a starting point for descriptor-based drug discovery.
