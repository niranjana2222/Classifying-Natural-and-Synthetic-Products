# Classifying Natural and Synthetic Products

Abstract

Historically, the distinction between natural and synthetic products has been unclear in the pharmaceutical industry22. Natural products have high chemical diversity, biochemical specificity, and other properties that make them favorable as lead structures for drug discovery and differentiate them from synthetic compounds23. Identification of distinguishable properties of synthetic and natural compounds is applicable to a variety of practices within cheminformatics. This paper proposes a novel machine learning approach with the PaDEL descriptor software to develop a method of classification for natural and synthetic products with an ensemble of algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to determine the feature importance amongst the molecular descriptors. The experimental accuracy of the best-performing machine learning method outlined in this paper, Random Forest, reached an accuracy of 89.19%, on par with and at times outperforming previous models performing this classification.
